# Parametric optimizable beam

A project focusing on a finite-element method formulation-based straight 3D parametric optimizable Timoshenko beam

Motivated but not limited to usage in education as well as for research purposes

With effort made to be compatible/usable with the interface of [Kratos Multiphisics](https://github.com/KratosMultiphysics)

The project is free under the BSD-3 license
