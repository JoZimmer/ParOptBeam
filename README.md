# Parametric optimizable beam
A project focusing on a finite-element method formulation-based straight 3D parametric optimizable Timoshenko beam
Motivated but not limited to usage in education as well as for research purposes
With effort made to be compatible/usable with the interface of [Kratos Multiphisics](https://github.com/KratosMultiphysics)
The project is free under the BSD-3 license
